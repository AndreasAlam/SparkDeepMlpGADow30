A Deep Neural-Network based Stock Trading System based on Evolutionary Optimized Technical Analysis Parameters

"In this study, we propose a stock trading system based on optimized technical analysis parameters for creating buy-sell points
using 	__genetic algorithms__. The model is developed utilizing Apache Spark big data platform. The optimized parameters are then
passed to 	__a deep MLP neural network__ for buy-sell-hold predictions. Dow 30 stocks are chosen for model validation. Each Dow
stock is trained separately using daily close prices between 1996-2016 and tested between 2007-2016. The results indicate that
optimizing the technical indicator parameters not only enhances the stock trading performance but also provides a model that
might be used as an alternative to Buy and Hold and other standard technical analysis models." 


"Utilizing optimized technical analysis feature parameter values as input features for neural network stock trading
system is the basis for our proposed model. We used 	__genetic algorithms to optimize RSI parameters__ for uptrend and
downtrend market conditions. Then, we used those optimized feature values as buy-sell trigger points for our deep
neural network data set. We used Dow 30 stocks to validate our model. The results indicate that such a trading
system produces comparable or better results when compared with Buy & Hold and other trading systems for a wide
range of stocks even for relatively longer periods."
