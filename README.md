A Deep Neural-Network based Stock Trading System based on Evolutionary Optimized Technical Analysis Parameters

We propose a stock trading system based on optimized technical analysis parameters for creating buy-sell points using genetic algorithms. The model is developed utilizing Apache Spark big data platform. The optimized parameters are then passed to a deep MLP neural network for buy-sell-hold predictions.
